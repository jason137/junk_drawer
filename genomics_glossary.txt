k-mer - a contiguous nucleotide sequence of length k, analogous to an n-gram (k=2 --> dimer, k=3 --> trimer)
kinase - enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation
local alignment
M. genitalium
Markov model
master regulatory gene - gene that produces proteins which control the expression (?) of other genes
metabolic network - complete set of processes that determine the physiological/biochemical properties of a cell (including metabolic pathways & regulatory interactions)
metabolic pathway - sequence of steps through which one chemical is transformed into another (reactions catalyzed by enzymes)
metabolism - complex network of chemical reactions that take place in a cell and allow the cell to interact with its environment, derive necessary energy and nutrients, and eventually to reproduce
